# JavaChip8Emu

This is just a practice project implementing a Chip8 emulator in Java using AWT and updating the pixels directly.

A decription of Chip-8 from wikipedia:

> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for said computers.

The respoitory includes a .project file, created in Eclipse Neon (4.6.0).
The source was compiled with Java 8 (1.8.0) - although it uses no Java 8 specific features.
